# This is my version of the game Bulls and Cows. The game works almost identical to 4digits in the sense where a user has 8 tries to guess the 4 digit secret number. All guesses must contain unique digits and must be 4 digits long. The only difference my version has compared to 4digits is that the secret code can begin with a 0, so users are allowed to begin their 4 digit guesses with 0.
